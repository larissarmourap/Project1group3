## Predictors of Pregnancy Risks
Our research aims to identify the key indicators that influence risk levels during pregnancy. We are using a dataset taken from various hospitals, clinics and maternal health care centers in Bangladesh, India. Our primary focus is analyzing age, blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar to determine their impact on predicted risk intensity level of pregnancy complication.
